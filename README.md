# Point
Behind this enigmatic name point-distance-maths-maker is hidden. Its goal in life is to find a distance between two points in coordinate system. If there is no input, the coordinates are set to (0, 0) by default.

Other then few getters, setters and constructors in Point class, there is also overloaded method distance. If you don't pass any parameters, it will return distance from set point to (0, 0). If you pass two parameters (x, y), it will return distance from set point to (x, y). It can also return distance from other, already set point.

Tbh it was kinda fun to poke around with math and class stuff. I also put syntactic sugar to practice, if you will, with math function (and didn't mess with parenthesis).
